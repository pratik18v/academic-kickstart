I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at Stony Brook University, advised by [Amir Rahmati](https://amir.rahmati.com/). My research falls under the umbrella of Adversarial Machine Learning. More specifically, I investigate techniques that can improve robustness of visual recognition models.
